// PR7-C's factory presets, filed the way PR7-X files its rigs (the owner's
// ask): seven banks, A drums, B bass, C guitars, D synths and keys, E vocals
// and voice, F the mix, G mastering. In each bank, 01 to 10 are single
// presets; 11 to 19 are the nine genre sets and 31 to 38 the eight
// signature-sound sets, one preset per part of a song (vocal, drums,
// guitars, bass, mix, master) at the same number in each bank, so a whole
// song can be set up from one style. "Default" comes first, outside the
// banks.
//
// They're our own reading of each sound and style, not anyone's settings,
// and never tuned by ear: starting points to adjust.
